# 🕵️‍♂️ Responsible AI Inspector Assignment

This project explores how artificial intelligence (AI) is used in real-world scenarios, identifies ethical concerns, and proposes responsible improvements. The assignment was completed in the format of a short, blog-style report to engage readers while highlighting key fairness and accountability issues.

## 📄 Overview

As a Responsible AI Inspector, I investigated two AI scenarios:

1. **Hiring Bot Bias**

Each case includes:
- A description of how AI is used
- Identification of ethical and social risks
- A recommendation to improve the system responsibly
